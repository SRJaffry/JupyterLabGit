How to remove a file from remote repository (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2047465/how-can-i-delete-a-file-from-a-git-repository)

git rm file1.txt
git commit -m "I am removing file1.txt"
git push origin branch_name

---------------How to pull a single remote repository------------------------------

First see the link below for a pictorial understanding
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/what-is-the-difference-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch

Let's see I want to pull the file main.scss from my remote repo.
First, check that I'll land myself on the right branch, then check the remote repo using (git remote -v), then fetch all the files from there. 
Finally, git checkout.

git branch  
git remote -v  
git fetch --all  
git checkout origin/main -- src/scss/main.scss



------------ pull from remote repo to local repo, and upload the local files to remote--------------
# following all above, like commit, etc etc...
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main


---- How to push new changes to remote reposirtyr---

# first run 'git status' to check the status
# use "git add ." (or specific filename in place of dot)
# For the 'Changes not staged for comit' we have files that are already added to the track, but new changes have been made and we need to commit those changes
commit -m 'message'

git status
vim <filename> # Example changes made in the file
git add . #(for filename)
git commit -m "message"
git status
git fetch --all # It is always a good practice to pull everything from remote before pushing it.
git push -u origin main

---- In the gitbash, how can I change the name of my master branch into main--------------

git branch main      # Create a new branch named "main"
git checkout main   # Switch to the new "main" branch
git push -u origin main   # Push the "main" branch and set it as the upstream branch
git branch -d master   # Delete the local "master" branch
